# Lattice: A Hierarchical Schedule Manager

## Project Overview

_Lattice_ is a hierarchical schedule/task manager that lets users quickly capture events by voice, organize them into nested sub-tasks, and manage schedules clearly with local persistence and an intuitive Compose UI.

Primary use cases
- Create, edit, delete, and query tasks (CRUD).
- Mark tasks as done or not done; completed items can be hidden from the main list.
- Build task trees with unlimited nesting (e.g., goal A split into sub-tasks B/C/D); expand/collapse levels.
- Use speech-to-text to draft a task quickly (e.g., “tomorrow 9 am review algorithms, three parts: derivation, practice, summary”).
